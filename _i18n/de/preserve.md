# DE: How you can help preserve glacier ice?

  <strong>
    In the long-term, every kg of reduced CO2 emissions results in 16kg less
    global mountain glacier mass loss

Giant blankets or artificial snow may slow down ice losses of individual
glaciers, but these approaches are extremely cost and labour-expensive, and
would only be feasible on a few selected glaciers. The funds would be better
spent on addressing the root cause: greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, these
geoengineering options also impact the local environment through e.g. plastic
degradation for the tarps or necessary artificial water reservoirs and change
the landscape enormously. 


**Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is the most effective way to preserve
glacier ice ([Huss et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1038/s44221-024-00269-8)).** 

We need to reduce climate emissions to reduce climate change impacts, one of
which is melting glaciers. Glacier loss contributes in the long-term to sea-level
rise (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03302-y" target="_blank">
Edwards et al., 2021</a>) and can reduce the mountain water availability in dry
periods or droughts (<a href="https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-13-935-2022" target="_blank">
Ultee et al., 2022</a>). 


### **What can you do?**

**1. Reduce your ecological footprint**<br>


Start making small changes in your daily life to lower your emissions! Use a
<a href="https://www.footprintcalculator.org/home/en" target="_blank">footprint calculator</a>
to explore where you can make the most impact.

For example:

- Minimise transport miles of what you consume.
- Avoid air travel as much as possible.
- Choose public transport, biking, walking, or carpooling over driving solo.
- Reduce your consumption of meat and dairy by incorporating more plant-based
  meals, preferably made from locally and seasonally produced ingredients.

If you want to visit some of the remaining glaciers in the Alps and live in
Europe, you can still do so sustainably by traveling via public transport.
Explore hiking tours in the Alps that are accessible by public transit on the
<a href="https://www.zuugle.at" target="_blank">zuugle website (entire Alps,
not available in English but in many other languages) </a> or
<a href="https://www.bahn-zum-berg.at/" target="_blank">"Bahn-zum-Berg" website </a>
(only for Austria, can be translated by your webbrowser to English). 
<br>

**2. Enlarge your handprint by engaging in transformations**<br>


Want to make an even bigger difference? Your "handprint" represents the positive
impact you create by contributing to societal and political transformations for
a better future.

Besides voting and going to a climate demonstration, you can find
transformation-engaging activities that fit to your personality. For example:

- Advocate for more plant-based meal options in your workplace cafeteria.
- Organize a “walking bus” for kids in your community to promote sustainable
  commuting.

Your efforts, especially when joined with others, can inspire meaningful change
and create lasting impacts far beyond individual actions. <br>

<br> There are two German websites with even more information: the

and <a href="https://www.handabdruck.eu/handabdruck-test" target="_blank">an
interactive Handprint Test that finds ideas depending on your personality</a>.
Both websites can be easily translated into English via your webbrowser.
