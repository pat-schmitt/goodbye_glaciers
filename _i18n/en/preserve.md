    In the long-term, every kg of reduced CO2 emissions results in 16kg less
    global mountain glacier mass loss

Giant blankets or technical snow may slow down ice losses, but these approaches are cost and labour-expensive, and
are only feasible on small scales. The only option to save entire glaciers is addressing the root cause of their melting: greenhouse gas emissions. In addition,
geoengineering options also impact negatively the local environment through e.g. plastic
degradation for the tarps or necessary artificial water reservoirs. 


**Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is the most effective way to preserve
glacier ice ([Huss et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1038/s44221-024-00269-8)).** 

We need to reduce planet-warming emissions to reduce climate change impacts, one of
which is melting glaciers. Glacier loss contributes in the long-term to sea-level
rise (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03302-y" target="_blank">
Edwards et al., 2021</a>) and reduces the regional water availability in dry
seasons or during droughts (<a href="https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-13-935-2022" target="_blank">
Ultee et al., 2022</a>). 


### **What can you do?**

**1. Reduce your carbon footprint**<br>


Start making small changes in your daily life to lower your carbon footprint.

For example:

- Minimise transport miles of what you consume.
- Avoid air travel as much as possible.
- Choose public transport, biking, walking, or carpooling instead of driving alone.
- Reduce your consumption of meat and dairy by incorporating more plant-based
  meals, preferably made from locally and seasonally produced ingredients.

This <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-58171814" target="_blank">BBC news article</a> describes further how you can make the most impact. All actions for a healthy Planet are also summarised on <a href="https://www.un.org/en/actnow/ten-actions" target="_blank">this United Nations website</a>. 

If you want to visit some of the remaining glaciers in the Alps and live in
Europe, you can still do so sustainably by traveling via public transport.
Explore hiking tours in the Alps that are accessible by public transport on the

not available in English but in many other languages) or on the 
<a href="https://www.bahn-zum-berg.at"><img src="/assets/images/logos/logo_bahn_zum_berg.png" alt="Logo Bahn zum Berg" style="height: 35px; width: auto;" /> "Bahn zum Berg" website</a> (only for tours in Austria, South Tirol, or Bavaria, can be translated by your webbrowser to English).

**2. Enlarge your handprint by engaging in transformations**<br>


Want to make an even bigger difference? Your "handprint" represents the positive
impact you create by contributing to societal and political transformations for
a better future.

Besides voting or going to a climate demonstration, you can find
transformation-engaging activities that fit to your personality. For example:

- Advocate for more plant-based meal options in your workplace cafeteria.
- Organize a “walking bus” for kids in your community to promote sustainable
  commuting.

Your efforts, especially when joined with others, can inspire meaningful change
and create lasting impacts far beyond individual actions. <br>

and <a href="https://www.handabdruck.eu/handabdruck-test" target="_blank">an
interactive Handprint Test that finds ideas depending on your personality</a>.
Both websites can be easily translated into English via your web browser.
