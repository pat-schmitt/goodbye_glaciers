<strong>This website is under construction, but feel free to already explore. We plan to have a complete version with additional glaciers and different languages by end of January.</strong>

# Goodbye Glaciers ?!

**A hiking signpost project to raise glacier loss awareness**<br>
Stimulated by the International Year of Glaciers’ Preservation 2025, the "Goodbye Glaciers ?!" project envisions signposts across Europe — from cities to mountain areas — pointing to glaciers and displaying the year when they will no longer be recognizable under current climate policies. Each signpost includes a QR code linking to this website, featuring photos, and three-dimensional projections into the future under 1.5°C and 2.7°C global warming. While we must say goodbye to many glaciers in Central Europe, ambitious emissions reductions can still preserve much glacier volume globally — this is the message we aim to share.

Our initiative builds on previous activities and comprehensive knowledge on the future evolution of glaciers under global warming. The main target of the initiative is to interact with the public and communicate in simple language which glaciers with a focus on Central Europe are about to vanish in the next decades and which glaciers might be preserved by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and thus, global warming.

The initiative consists of three pillars:
- This website as central communication platform. Start with the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/signposts/">Glaciers</a> page to explore the key features.
- <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/signposts/">Signposts</a> to be placed wherever they can interact with people already familiar or not familiar with glaciers
- <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/events/">Public events</a> like exhibitions, guided tours or other activities

We invite everyone to participate in or contribute to this initiative. Please find our contacts <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/about/">here</a>.
