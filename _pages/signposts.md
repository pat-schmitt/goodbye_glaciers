# !!!Work in Progress!!!

# Signposts page

This is how we envision the signposts to look like: 
<img src="/assets/images/photos_signposts/prototype_idea.png" alt="Signpost idea" style="width: 850px; height: auto;" />



<p>This page will show where signposts are currently located (on a map and by country similar to the glaciers). When clicking on a signpost you will be redirected to a site, where you can see which glaciers are shown on this signpost (with links to the glacier sites), and maybe also a history of the signpost where it was previously located.</p>

<p>If you are interested to put up a signpost, write an e-mail to: wolfgang.gurgiser@uibk.ac.at</p>
